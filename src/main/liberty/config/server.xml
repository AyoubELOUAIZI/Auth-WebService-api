        Enable JSON-B (Java API for JSON Binding) support by adding the jsonb-3.0 feature.
        This feature provides functionality for serializing and deserializing Java objects to/from JSON format.
        By including this feature in the server configuration, Open Liberty ensures that the necessary components
        for JSON processing are available at the server level, allowing applications to seamlessly work with JSON data.
